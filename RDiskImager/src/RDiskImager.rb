# RDiskImager.rb
#
# Requires: Linux, ruby, dd, pv
#
# A nice, neat, command line interface that combines the dd and pv
# commands so that pv automatically knows the size of the device
# being imaged, and dd automatically runs through pv so the user
# can see the progress of the backup
#
# For now, this script has to be run as root to work
